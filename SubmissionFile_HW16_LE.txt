### Step 5: Zenmap

Your client has asked that you help identify any vulnerabilities with their file-sharing server. Using the Metasploitable machine to act as your client's server, complete the following:

- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine: 

nmap -T4 -F 192.168.0.10
 
 

- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`:

nmap -T4 -F -oN zenmapscan.txt 192.168.0.10
 
 

- Zenmap vulnerability script command: 
namp -T4 -F --script ftp-vsftpd-backdoor,smb-enum-shares 192.168.0.10
 

 

- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:
  1. What is the vulnerability:
CVE-2011-2523:Zenmap was able to enumerate the vulnerable service running on port 21.  

 


  2. Why is it dangerous:
The vsftpd v2.3.4 is vulnerable to a backdoor command execution, whcih present a threat to running this particular version of software. Successful execution of this vulnerability results in opening the backdoor port 6200 of the system and running as root.

  3. What mitigation strategies can you recommendations for the client to protect their server: 
I recommmend constant monitoring and updating with the patch for vsfptd 2.3.4.  The vsFPTD 2.3.4 patch was released on July 3, 2011.
